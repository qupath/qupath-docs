QuPaths allows you to view and work with single images.
However, if you will be saving and reloading data associated with multiple images it is *highly* recommended to use a **Project**.

**Projects** provide a way to:

- Group together related images
- Easily switch between images (by clicking on thumbnails in the project image list)
- Organize your data files, along with scripts, classifiers and other useful things
- View a larger thumbnail and some file data by hovering the mouse over an image, without needing to open it fully

:::{tip}
Using QuPath without creating a project should be the exception rather than the rule (e.g. when wanting to quickly view an image, but not save any data).

Some commands and scripts *only* work within projects.
:::

## Create a project

### Choose a folder

The first step of creating a project is to create an empty folder somewhere on your computer.
You can then set this to be the project directory in one of two ways:

1. Through {menuselection}`File --> Project... --> Create new project`
2. Drag the folder on top of QuPath

:::{warning}
The new project folder *must* be empty.
QuPath will assume it's allowed to do whatever you like within the folder you give it - which may include overwriting files.

For this reason, it's best to leave the management of that folder entirely up to QuPath and to avoid adding, removing or renaming files manually within it.
:::

### Add images

The easiest way to add images to a project is usually to drag them on top of QuPath.

This opens a dialog box, which shows a list of images to import and provides some options to customize how it will happen.

Dragging images on top of QuPath for project import
:::

The options are:

> - **Image provider:** This is the {doc}`library used to read the images <../intro/formats>`. The default is to allow QuPath to make this decision, but in some cases (e.g. a file type that you know Bio-Formats handles better than OpenSlide) you may prefer to take control and specify which library to use.
> - **Image type:** Setting the image type is often the first thing you should do when opening an image in QuPath. This can save you the effort by setting the type on import.
> - **Rotation:** Specify that the image should be rotated in an increment of 90 degrees. The file itself will not be changed, but QuPath will treat the image as if it has the new orientation.
> - **Auto-generate pyramids:** If selected, QuPath will dynamically generate a pyramid for large-but-not-too-large images (e.g. 10,000 x 10,000 pixels) that don't already have multiple stored resolutions. These images are small enough to fit in memory, but big enough to be unwieldy. For most whole slide images (which are already pyramidal) this has no effect.
> - **Auto-generate pyramids:** For large single resolution images, QuPath can generate pyramids to handle the images data more efficiently.
> - **Import Objects:** If selected then any objects (e.g. annotations) saved in the image file will be imported into the project. This is useful if you have already annotated the image in another software and want to bring these annotations into QuPath.
> - **Show image selector:** The image selector window adds an additional step to importing which allows you to select which of the images being imported to accept or not import. This is particularly useful whenever the same URI contains multiple images. When off, this will result in all images being imported.

:::{tip}
You can also use {menuselection}`File --> Project... --> Add images` to add multiple images to a project.
This option is especially useful if you have a text file containing project URIs for images strewn across a file system, since these can be pasted into the dialog in one go.
:::

:::{tip}
You can also merge projects using the `Add images` dialog.
Simply add the *project.qpproj* file from another compatible QuPath project to bring all images into the current project.
:::

### Remove images

You can remove images by right-clicking one or more entries under the *Project* tab and choosing {menuselection}`Remove image(s)`.

You can choose whether to also delete all associated data from within the project (e.g. annotations).
If you choose not to, these files will linger around - you won't be able to access them easily (because the image isn't in the project), but they may be retrievable in an emergency.

:::{note}
On platforms that support it, QuPath will try to remove data by sending it to the recycle bin rather than permanently deleting it immediately.

### Sorting images
Within the project it is possible to sort images by name, ID URI (path to the image file) or none (which is the order of import).
To see the options, right click on the project pane and select {menuselection}`Sort by...`.

It's also possible to add new sortable parameters by adding metadata to the images.
This can be done by right clicking on the image and selecting {menuselection}`Add metadata`.

### Alternative project viewing
Image thumbnails can be increased in size by right clicking and selecting {menuselection}`Thumbnail size` and choosing a larger size or hide them for blinded studies.
Additionally the names of the images can be masked by right clicking and selecting {menuselection}`Mask image names`. To undo this, right click again and select {menuselection}`Mask image names`.

## Working with projects

### Reopen a project

There are four ways to reopen an existing project:

- Drag the project folder onto QuPath
- Drag the `qpproj` file within the project folder onto QuPath
- Use {menuselection}`File --> Project... --> Open project`
- Use {menuselection}`File --> Recent projects... --> [your project]`

### Fix paths

It is important to recognize that your project folder does **not** (usually) contain your images.
Rather, it contains QuPath's associated data files only - and the paths to where your images are located.

*This means that if your image files change location, QuPath may not be able to find them any more.*

QuPath previously left you on your own to somehow fix that.
Now, it tries to be more helpful by providing a dialog box to fix the paths when needed, highlighting those that are missing in red.

:::{figure} images/project_fixing.png
:class: shadow-image mid-image

Finding missing images when opening a project
:::

Within this dialog, you can double-click the space beside a 'red' entry and locate the file.
You can also press the {guilabel}`Search...` button and choose a directory, after which QuPath will try to fix the paths for all missing names that can be found within this directory.

If you choose {guilabel}`Apply changes` then your project will be updated with the new paths.
If you choose {guilabel}`Ignore` then your project will not be overwritten, but some images will not open.

:::{tip}
In the event that your images and project *both* changed location together, QuPath will try to resolve the paths relative to the project and suggest how you should update them automatically.
