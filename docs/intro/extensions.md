# Extensions

(qupath-extensions)=

QuPath supports adding new features via extensions.
These are basically extra plugins that QuPath *can* work without - but which are often very useful.

The big advantage of extensions is that they make it possible to add new features to QuPath without needing to update the whole software.


## Finding extensions

You can find the list of extensions developed by the QuPath team by clicking on {menuselection}`Extensions --> Manage extensions` in QuPath.
This will show the extension manager that provides options for installing, updating, or removing extensions.

:::{admonition} Which extensions should I add?
:class: warning
Some key extensions from the QuPath team are:
* 🦠 {doc}`../deep/instanseg` -- better cell segmentation with deep learning
* 🤖 {doc}`../deep/djl` -- more deep learning support (required for InstanSeg!)
* 🔬 {doc}`../deep/wsinfer` -- patch-based deep learning inference
* ☁️ {doc}`../advanced/omero` -- work directly with images stored on OMERO
:::

You can also find extensions developed outside of the QuPath team:

* On the [user forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath).
* By searching [for QuPath on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=qupath).

:::{Note}
Extensions are installed in the QuPath user directory.
If it's not already set, QuPath will prompt you to select a folder.
You can change it later under {menuselection}`Edit --> Preferences...`, but be sure to copy any content you need to the new folder.

## Managing extensions with the extension manager

The easiest way to install, update, or remove an extension is to use the extension manager.
You can open it by clicking on {menuselection}`Extensions --> Manage extensions` in QuPath.

There, you will see a list of extensions grouped by *"catalog"*.

A catalog typically represents a collection of extensions developed by a specific group of people.
By default, you will only see the "QuPath catalog", which contains extensions developed by the QuPath team.

If the extension you want is present in this list, you can go to the next section.
Otherwise, click on {guilabel}`Manage extension catalogs` in the extension manager. This will open the extension catalog manager window.

:::

There, to add a catalog, enter the URL of the catalog and click on `Add`.
The URL will usually be a link to a GitHub repository containing a `catalog.json` file, provided by the author of the extension.

:::{Note}
If you are a QuPath extension developer and want to create your own catalog, you will find all necessary information on the [GitHub page of the catalog model](https://github.com/qupath/extension-catalog-model).
:::

Sometimes, the extension you want to install is not present in a catalog.
In that case, see the [Managing extensions without the extension manager](managing-without-manager) section.


### Installing extensions

Installing an extension with the extension manager is very easy.
You just need to click on the {guilabel}`+` green button next to the extension name. This will show the installation window.

:::

There, you can select the extension version and whether to install optional dependencies.
Not always present, optional dependencies are additional files that may add features to the extension (refer to the extension documentation for more information).

When you click on {guilabel}`Install`, the extension files will be downloaded and added to your QuPath user directory.
Often the extension will be ready to use immediately, but it’s generally a good idea to restart QuPath in case it needs to do any extra work at startup.


### Removing extensions

Once an extension is downloaded, new buttons will appear next to the extension name.

:::

Simply click on the {guilabel}`-` red button to remove the extension. You should then restart QuPath.


### Updating extensions

Sometimes, an extension you have installed can be updated.

:::

In that case, click on the cog button next to the extension name. This opens the edit extension window.

:::{figure} images/edit_extension.png
:class: shadow-image mid-image

The edit extension window
:::

This window is similar to the extension installation window, where you can specify the version and whether to install optional dependencies. Select the newest version and click on {guilabel}`Update`.
You should then restart QuPath.

## Managing extensions without the extension manager

Some extensions are not present in any catalog. In that case, you will have to manually manage them.


### Installing extensions

Extensions are usually hosted on a GitHub repository.
There, you will find instructions on how to install the extension.
It usually consists of downloading a file that ends with `.jar` from the `Releases` section of the GitHub repository.
If you drag this onto QuPath’s main window, QuPath should copy it to your QuPath user directory. You can also manually copy the jar to your QuPath user directory.

Often the extension will be ready to use immediately, but it’s generally a good idea to restart QuPath in case it needs to do any extra work at startup.

:::{caution}
Nothing prevents you from manually installing an extension that is already installed with the extension manager. However, this should be avoided.

### Removing extensions

Once you have manually installed an extension, it should appear in the extension manager (which can be open by clicking on {menuselection}`Extensions --> Manage extensions` in QuPath) at the bottom after all catalogs.

:::

There, you can click on the {guilabel}`-` red button to remove the extension.
You should then restart QuPath.
Alternatively, you can delete the jar file of the extension from your QuPath user directory.


### Updating extensions

Manually installed extensions can't be easily updated.
You have to remove them and install them again with the newer version.
