# QuPath Docs

This contains the source for QuPath's documentation, hosted at https://qupath.readthedocs.io

## Building locally

To build this locally, create a virtual environment, eg:

```bash
python -m venv ./venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

or using conda/mamba:

```bash
conda env create -n qupath-docs python=3.12
conda activate qupath-docs
```

Then install the requirements for this repo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need the command line tool `Make` (e.g., [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)).

Then, you can run `make` to see available build options.
`make html` will make the HTML version of the website, which is probably the
most useful option. The built HTML files will be in `_build/html`, and can
be opened in a web browser without running a local HTTP server.

Alternatively, you can install `sphinx-autobuild` and `watchfiles`
into your virtual environment to run a HTTP server and have the HTML files
automatically rebuilt when any changes are made:

```bash
sphinx-autobuild . _build/html
```
